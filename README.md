## About This Repo
This repo contains all code I have written in the User Interface Design class at Columbia University, COMS 4170, Fall 2013, by Professor Steven Feiner. The focus is not algorithm or efficiency, but rather the looking, or the design. The projects are done in Javascript, CSS, and HTML with some APIs (e.g. of Twitter, of Foursquare).

## Advanced Tweets Search
This project uses Coderbird as a proxy to invoke the Twitter APIs. As its name suggests, it is an advanced tweet search. You can search the tweets within a time interval, or tweeted in a specific location. You can also define the number of tweets to display. This project is used to demonstrate the UI Design principles, not code efficiency.

## Gesture Based HTML5 Video Player
The video player is made by the video tag of HTML 5 and the One-Dollar Recongnizers. This project is used to demonstrate that the user does not need to use keyboard at all in order to have a disturbance-free video-watching experience. The video player *** will play a video called ferro.mp4 (not included in the repo) once running ***. It is easy to make it play any video, but this is ***NOT*** implemented given that the purpose of the project.
